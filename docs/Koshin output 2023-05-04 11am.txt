So ... generally should just check the Custom.

Can check ~ 1,333 files per second.
So Custom will take around a second.
Checking all three takes around a minute.

Adding files to a set is around 200 per second.
So Custom is around 6 secs
Default is around 2.5 mins

Deleting is generally only a handful of files
so is pretty quick.

Copying files is around 10 per second
Actually pretty quick if relatively few have changed
Close to an hour if copying EVERYTHING
